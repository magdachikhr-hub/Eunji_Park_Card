          <h1>Eunji Park</h1>
          <p>
            Eunji founded Aetherfield with one goal: to help companies take
            climate action without waiting for a perfect plan. With a background
            in environmental systems and software design, she’s spent the past
            decade building tools that turn impact goals into real-world
            outcomes. She still insists on biking to every investor meeting.
